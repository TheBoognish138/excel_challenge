## Module 1 Challenge:
### •	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
We can conclude that most crowdfunding campaigns are for plays. Second, we can conclude that journalism has a 100% success rate. Finally, we can conclude that one is more likely to succeed in reaching their goal in the month of July.

### •	What are some limitations on this dataset?
Some limitations to this dataset include but are not limited to the wide range of currencies, the source of the data, and the sample size being limited.

### •	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
We could create a pivot table that compares the outcome of a compaign with the duration of the campaign. This could potentially figure out what time period a campaign is likely to cancel.

## Statistical Analysis:
•	Using the data provided, I have determined that the mean better summarizes the data.
•	There is more variability with successful campaigns, this makes sense because there is no ceiling for a successful campaign where a failed campaign can only be up to 1 value below the goal.
